# REFACTOR submission examples

Read [refactor instructions](refactor.md) and use only the example for the transition returned by Core.
Replace sample identities, artifacts, checks and user verdicts with current values.

Implementation: `internal/mcp/skill_examples_test.go`; `internal/mcp/skill_error_examples_test.go`;
`internal/mcp/skill_success_examples_test.go`.
