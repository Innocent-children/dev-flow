# local-provision: current-session

Implementation: `packages/codex/bin/dev-flow-codex.mjs` — `runHostLaunchCommand`.

Complete result from the adapter implementation, executed in a temporary Git fixture.
Host session creation, handoff completion and Core terminal reads are supplied test observations,
not live Host calls. Paths, generated identities, digests and timestamps use stable example values;
all fields and their references are retained and compared.
