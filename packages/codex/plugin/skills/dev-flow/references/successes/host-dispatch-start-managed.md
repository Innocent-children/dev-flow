# dispatch-start: managed

Implementation: `packages/codex/bin/dev-flow-codex.mjs` — `runHostLaunchCommand`.

Complete result from the adapter implementation, executed in a temporary Git fixture.
Host session creation, handoff completion and Core terminal reads are supplied test observations,
not live Host calls. Paths, generated identities, digests and timestamps use stable example values;
all fields and their references are retained and compared.

Resolved request:

```json
{
  "launch_id": "launch-example",
  "project_id": "project-example",
